'''
	This CommandHandlerBase class contains the bulk of dealing with the static data
	associated with a CommandHandler. The static fields allow us to:

	1) dispatch to the appropriate CommandHandler,

	2) perform existence and type validation of the data in the request

	3) check that the user has appropriate permissions to make a request for the
	   execution of a particular command

	4) provide a basic definition of the command to the front end so that
	   it can perform validation upfront and also minimize the number of
	   synchronization points between front end code and backend, since
	   the backend drives the available commands for the front end as well.

	The last thing that this class provides, is simply a #handle method that should
	be overridden in each of the command handlers in order actually process a request.
